# Finding the Happiness Factor

The following will be a tutorial on how to use data from different data sources and utilize the datascience pipeline to collect and curate, manage and represent, explore, test your hypothesis on, and communicate the insights found in 2 different sets of data. Hopefully by the end of this tutorial you will learn how to leverage this pipeline to find unique patterns and correlations. In the notebook, we be exploring the World Happiness Report for 2021 and the World Development Indicators to determine what development factors best correspond with increased happiness across the globe. We hope you enjoy this tutorial and maybe, just maybe, even figure out the key to world happiness. (No promises).
